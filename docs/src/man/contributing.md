# Contributing to the package

## Reporting issues

A simple yet very useful way to contribute to `BioEnergeticFoodWebs` is to
report issues on [GitHub][issues].

[issues]: https://github.com/PoisotLab/BioEnergeticFoodWebs.jl/issues "Open an issue"

Issues can be either reports of bugs, or suggestions of things to improve
in the package.

## Adding code and features

Please start by submitting an issue explaining what you would like to add. When
we merge your changes into a new release, we will give you authorship on
the DOI provided by [Zenodo][zenodo].

!!! tip
    When you contribute, please fork the `next` branch, and not the `master` one. In order to make sure that the `master` branch is always functional, we do not commit directly to it.
